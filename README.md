Miktotek DISC Lite5 AC Wifi 5 Mhz bridge longdistance.

Wifi 5 Mhz [Mikrotik Disc Lite5 ac](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/UM/Disc+Lite5+ac)
 * ARM 32-bit
 * Qualcomm ...

[Buy](https://mikrotik.com/buy), [example](https://www.mikrotik-store.eu/en/index?language=en) from Germany.

I know that there has used 60 km point to point bridge over year, average speed 45 Mbps. Weather - no problem.

## Test result
Used bridge confuguration (CPE + AP).  Used nv2 protocol, better than 802.11. Nv2 need pre-shared password. NV2 setup include cell radius setup, example 30 km.
Very sort test, tested on the lake ice at around -1Â°C in cloudy weather. Not done any special setups.
 * 130 meter - TCP/IP speed almost 400 Mbps, UDP over 400 Mbps, signal level 5
 * 300 m - TCP/IP speed 110-150 Mbps, signal level 4-5
 * 600 m - TCP/IP speed 130-150 Mbps
 * 1000 m - TCP/IP speed 60-100 Mbps, signal level 3
 * 1500 m - TCP/IP speed 40-60 Mbps, signal level 2-3

## Configuration
I used Winbox, GUI and also Terminal mode.
 * start Winbox
 * boot Disc
 * wait - some minutes
 * you will see disc mac address on the list, select it clicking mac address
 * connect using user **admin** without password
 * after 1st boot ask new password, old is empty

I reset configuration, not used defaults. Use Terminal:
```
/system reset-configuration no-defaults=yes skip-backup=yes

```

## Install packages
System => Packages
 * drop  *routeros-7.13.2-arm.npk* and wireless driver *wireless-7.13.2-arm.npk* to this box
 * reboot

After reboot check System => Packages, you'll see that there are two packages installed

## Setup Identity
Terminal or System => Identity
```
# AP - set
/system identity set name=EX1AP
# CPE / Station - set
/system identity set name=EX1CPE
/system identity set name=EX1AP
```

## Enable wlan1
Default is: off

Wireless => Wireless => Wifi Interfaces => enable line wlan1 
 Or using Terminal
```
/interface set wlan1 disabled=no
```


## Setup Bridge
Bridge => 
 * + (add) - bridge1
 * Ports add wlan1 and ether1

## Setup IP
IP => Address list => + (new)
* AP 192.168.33.211, network 255.255.255.0, Interface: **bridge1**
* CPE 192.168.33.212, network 255.255.255.0, Interface: **bridge1**

## Setup Wireless

Interfaces => wlan1 => tab: Wireless

* change Advanced Mode
* Mode: bridge
* Band 
  * AP: 5GHz.A/N/AC
  * CPE: 5Hz-only-AC = work in short distance (in my test under 1.5 km)
    * CPE try band and channel width, AP has more dynamic setup (=listen)
* Channel width: 20/40/80Mhz eeeC worked in my test, longer distance width have to be 10/20 ?
* Frequency: ex. 5580 
* SSID: EX1
* Radioname - only for more readable reading
  AP: EX1AP
  CPE: EX1CPE
* Wireless Protocol: nv2
  ** NV2 tab setup security and Pre-shared password 
* Country: select your country
